== Data Structure

=== Array

* Contiguous block in memory.
* Every element occupies the same amount of space in memory.
* If an array starts at memory address A, and size of each element in the array is S. We can calculate the memory address of the i^th^ element by using the following expression: A + i * S
* Therefore, if we know the index of an element, the time to retrieve the element will be same, no matter where it is in the array.

==== Retrieve an Element from an Array

* Multiply the Array element size(uniform) by the index.
* Get the start address of the array.
* Add the start address to the result of the multiplication.


.Time complexity
|===
| Operation | Complexity

| Retrieve with index | O(1)
| Retrieve without index | O(n)
| Add an element to a full array | O(n)
| Add an element to the end of an array (has space) | O(1)
| Insert or update an element at an specific index | O(1)
| Delete an element by setting it to default values, e.g., null, 0,.. | O(1)
| Delete an element by shifting elements | O(n)
