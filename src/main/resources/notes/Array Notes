/**
 * Arrays can hold either primitives or object references, but an array itself will always be
 * an object on the heap, even if the array is declared to hold primitive elements
 *
 * It is never legal to include the size of the array in your declaration.
 *
 * JVM doesn'example allocate space until you actually instantiate the array object. That's when size matters.
